# A story in need of elaboration

There once was a young individual who wanted to learn coding. They had heard
about the legendary monster `git` and were terrified of incurring its wrath. To

chaos, aligning the stars of main and feature, and sealing the harmony 
with `git merge main`._ And after that, all was right in the world and in their
codebase. The end.
